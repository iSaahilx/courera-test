                Tomato butter works wonders on roast chicken—not only does it keep the bird moist, but the healthy dose of tomato paste brings a slightly sweet, umami acidity to the whole dish. Plus, there are no better veggies than ones that have been roasted underneath a chicken, collecting all of that flavor-packed schmaltz.Roast chicken is a classic dish that has been enjoyed for centuries. It’s simple, versatile, and delicious, making it a favorite for both home cooks and professional chefs. However, sometimes it’s nice to switch things up and try something new. Enter tomato butter roast chicken, a dish that adds a unique twist to the traditional roast chicken recipe.

            <p class="pp1">Beef stew is a cold weather essential. While it's a perfect meal all on its own, we also love beef stew served over some al dente egg noodles. Want something a little heartier? Try ladling a bit of stew over some garlic mash.While beef stew is a perfect meal all on its own, we also love beef stew served over some al dente egg noodles.

            <p class="pp1">spicy tuna sushi rolls usually involve raw, sushi-grade fish. But if raw fish is out of reach, this recipe uses humble canned tuna. That’s not to say you can’t use the basic skeleton of this recipe for raw tuna if you can find it—just substitute in sushi-grade fish, finely chopped,To spice up our tuna, I used sriracha and mayo. If you already have spicy mayo on hand, perfect, use it! If you have to make it from scratch, I’d highly recommend Kewpie mayo, which contains MSG and adds that extra bump of umami into the mix. You can also use sambal oelek to turn up the spice level! </p>
